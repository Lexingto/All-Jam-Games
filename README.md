Trijam #133: The 3 hour game jam -> https://lexingto.itch.io/keep-it-up | (This was not one of my best games I have made, this was my first 3 hour game jam and I severly overestimated what I could do in 3 hours and learnt what I can and can not do in such a short amount of time)


(COLLAB) Low Effort Jam #13 -> https://lexingto.itch.io/delivery-driver | (the person I was working with on this was doing the programming, because I wanted to better and practice my 3D modelling and audio abilities. had some issues he had to deal with in real life so I had to do the majority of the programming too when I was not expecting to have to do them so it was a bit thrown together last second and I could not refine it as much as I wanted to)

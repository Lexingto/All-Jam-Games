Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1 ->  https://lexingto.itch.io/dog-finder

My first public game jam I did and I went with a basic platformer to have a submission for the jam.

Just Another Jam #2 -> https://lexingto.itch.io/title-not-found

I like this game I made, I like the art I found for it and was able to make a game that was nice on the eyes, i made this with speedrunning in mind and I believe I executed it quite well.

(COLLAB) Make A Level (MAY DAY 2021) -> https://lexingto.itch.io/mothers-day-escapade

This was my first collobarative game jam, I had a good time working on this one although we had to alter the art style drastically due to not finding the art assets we wanted. We wanted the art to be inside of a shopping mall and have to knock over other pedestrians who get in the players way and potential take their gifts. After this game jam I have been trying to learn how to do other aspects of game development so I don't have to make sacrifices to the game like this.

Mini Jam 80 -> https://lexingto.itch.io/cat-bit-adventure

I wanted to try to make a game inspired from My Friend Pedro and put my own take on it, my take on the game was it being focused around cats and in an 8bit format with Jump Pads and no slow down ability to make it more hectic, i don't think my execution on this was well done, I think the appearance of the game is quite boring and the mechanics feel clunky, more polish on this is much needed and If i polished this more i believe it would be a better game.

GMTK 2021 -> https://lexingto.itch.io/ted-and-rosie

After two failed attempts in exploring an idea I had, one was a game where you had to make the character complete a level by completing an IF statement, this was scrapped due to it not being fun to play, the second was going to be a 3D game, I eventually took the obvious idea of two playable characters just so I could submit something but I did want to explore having two controllable characters anyway but due to the angle I took this game wasn't the most creative take on the theme I enjoyed learning about how to make a grappling hook and after the Jam i learnt how to make it work properly so it latches onto objects I want it to latch onto.

GJL Game Parade Summer 2021 -> https://lexingto.itch.io/viable

This is one of the better games I have made and it was featured here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpWqiLjZDbE (1:06)) I learnt what is successful in game jams which I believe at the time of writing this is to be fun and engaging gameplay loops, which is what I went into this game jam wanting to try out and I am tailoring my games to be primarily a fun and engaging gameplay loop which can be played for an extended period of time.

Trijam #133: The 3 hour game jam -> https://lexingto.itch.io/keep-it-up

This was not one of the best games I have made, this was my first 3 hour game jam and I severly overestimated what I could do in 3 hours and learnt what I can and can not do in such a short amount of time, due to me overestimating how much I can do it resulted in a lack of content for the player to play and a clumsy look to the game.

(COLLAB) Low Effort Jam #13 -> https://lexingto.itch.io/delivery-driver 

We treated this as a 48 hour game jam as that fitted our schedules the best and the person I was working with on this was doing the programming, because I wanted to better and practice my 3D modelling and audio abilities, he and I both wanted to learn how car physics work so he watched a youtube tutorial and figured it out and wrote a script following the tutorial. On the second day, he had some unforeseen issues he had to deal with in real life so I did the majority of the programming when I was not expecting too so it was thrown together last second and I could not refine it as much as I wanted to so it turned into a semi complete jam game.
